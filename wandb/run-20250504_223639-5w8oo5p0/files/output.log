[2025-05-04 22:36:41,555][timm.models._builder][INFO] - Loading pretrained weights from Hugging Face hub (timm/resnet50.a1_in1k)
[2025-05-04 22:36:41,662][timm.models._hub][INFO] - [timm/resnet50.a1_in1k] Safe alternative available for 'pytorch_model.bin' (as 'model.safetensors'). Loading weights using safetensors.
[2025-05-04 22:36:41,692][timm.models._builder][INFO] - Missing keys (fc.weight, fc.bias) discovered while loading pretrained weights. This is expected if model is being adapted.
Some weights of the model checkpoint at facebook/detr-resnet-50 were not used when initializing DetrForObjectDetection: ['model.backbone.conv_encoder.model.layer1.0.downsample.1.num_batches_tracked', 'model.backbone.conv_encoder.model.layer2.0.downsample.1.num_batches_tracked', 'model.backbone.conv_encoder.model.layer3.0.downsample.1.num_batches_tracked', 'model.backbone.conv_encoder.model.layer4.0.downsample.1.num_batches_tracked']
- This IS expected if you are initializing DetrForObjectDetection from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing DetrForObjectDetection from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
